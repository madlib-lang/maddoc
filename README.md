# MadDoc
MadDoc is a document generator that takes as input the json file generated by `madlib doc` command.

## How to run it

### Run the frontend
```bash
npm i
madlib install
npm run dev
```

### Run the CLI

madlib run src/CLI/Main.mad FOLDER

Where `FOLDER` is the location of the sources you want to generate a documentation for.
The generated documentation site is then saved in the `.docs` folder.
