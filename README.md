# MadDoc
MadDoc is a document generator that takes as input the json file generated by `madlib doc` command.

## How to run it
```bash
madlib install
npm run dev
```
Currently, MadDoc frontend expects a doc file named `documentation.json` to be located in the `src/` folder. You can generate this one using the `madlib doc` command. Run `madlib doc --help` for more information.
