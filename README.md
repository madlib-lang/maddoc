# MadDoc
MadDoc is a document generator that takes as input the json file generated by `madlib doc` command.

## How to run it

### Run the frontend
```bash
npm i
madlib install
npm run dev
```
Currently, MadDoc frontend expects a doc file named `documentation.json` to be located in the `src/` folder. You can generate this one using the `madlib doc` command. Run `madlib doc --help` for more information.

### Run the CLI
```bash
madlib run src/CLI/Main.mad FOLDER
```
Where `FOLDER` is the location of the sources you want to generate a documentation for.
The generated documentation site is then saved in the `.docs` folder.


## Note
This package is still under active development.
